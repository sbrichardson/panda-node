When a panda powers up, by default it's in "SAFETY_NOOUTPUT" mode. While in no output mode, the buses are also forced to be silent. In order to send messages, you have to select a safety mode. Currently, setting safety modes is only supported over USB.

Safety modes can also optionally support "controls_allowed", which allows or blocks a subset of messages based on a piece of state in the board.
